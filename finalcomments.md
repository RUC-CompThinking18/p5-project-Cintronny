# Interactivity
I like that the snowflakes respond to the mouse cursor. It might have been nice to give the option to "shake", but that involves some pretty annoying physics, so I'm not going to raise a fuss.

# Code quality
You demonstrated real problem-solving skills with this project. You got P5's tough drawing functions down, including a good use of the persnickety translate and rotate combo.

I would have liked some more comments that gave a bit more sense of the "why" of particular pieces of code.

# Aesthetics
I thought this was a lovely little project that, as you say, is appropriate for the end of the semester. Great work.
